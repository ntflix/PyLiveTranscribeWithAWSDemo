Demo of using AWS transcribe to transcribe live audio captured from the microphone and print the results to the console.
Not designed as a module or anything, just a demo of how you could use the AWS transcribe service.
Most of the AWS part is a total rip off of the AWS documentation, apart from the chunking of the audio stream from the microphone.
